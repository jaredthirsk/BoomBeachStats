# Welcome to the BoomBeachStats!

Detect who didn't attack in Operations, so that you can kick them with impunity.  (Or after several friendly warnings, if that's how you roll.)

## Roster

Put the current member list here.  One member per line.  _**Case-sensitive**_

## Attackers

Click the calendar day for the day the op ended (or started, but be consistent).
Then put the list of people who attacked in there.   One member per line.  _**Case-sensitive**_ 

## Who didn't attack

Slider: how many days to go back. Defaults to 3.

Press the button, and get a list of who didn't attack, and how many attacks they missed, and which dates.

Note that there is currently no detection for whether they are new in the task force.
